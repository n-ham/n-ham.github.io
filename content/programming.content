<p>
	I created and develop a cross-platform open source website manager called <a href="https://nift.dev">Nift</a>. It has <a href="https://luajit.org/">LuaJIT</a> and <a href="http://www.partow.net/programming/exprtk/">ExprTk</a> (<a href="https://github.com/ArashPartow/exprtk">GitHub</a>) embedded along with in-built languages <mnstr>Functionstein</mnstr> for scripting and <mnstr>Templatestein</mnstr> for templating, and has a shell extension called <flsh>Flashell</flsh>.

<p>
	I coded together the world's fastest implementation of <mono>lolcat</mono> which I call <a href="https://github.com/n-ham/lolcat-cc">lolcat-cc</a>. Check out especially the <a href="https://nift.dev/docs/fns/lolcat.on.html">lolcat.on</a> function for the <mono>Nift</mono> <a href="https://nift.dev/docs/REPL.html#shell">shell extension</a>.

<h3>Google ai challenges</h3>

<p>
	From 2010-2011 using the identity <mono>antimatroid</mono> I competed in, and contributed to designing and building an international artificial intelligence programming contest sponsored by Google, commonly known as the Google ai challenges. Each participant wrote a self-contained computer program, also known as a bot, to play a game against other people's bots. Once submissions were closed for each challenge, bots were matched against each other and ranked based on their performance.

<h4>contributions</h4>
<ul>
	<li>
		I was a significant <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20140102030230/http://ants.aichallenge.org/credits.php">contributor</a> to designing and building the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20140102030245/http://ants.aichallenge.org/index.php">Ants challenge</a>, we ended up having 7897 people submit a bot;
	</li> 
	<li>
		I was the primary designer and author of the map generators for both the Planet Wars and Ants challenges (see for example <a href="https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/blob/epsilon/ants/mapgen/mapgen.py">mapgen.py</a>, <a href="https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/blob/epsilon/ants/mapgen/symmetric_mapgen.py">symmetric-mapgen.py</a> and <a href="https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/blob/epsilon/ants/mapgen/asymmetric_mapgen.py">asymmetric-mapgen.py</a>, I also independently worked out how to do symmetric n player maps on the surface of a torus (edges wrapped) which was used for the map generator(s) I cowboy coded and possibly by other people as well. I also wrote code that was able to run some tests on a given map to ensure it meet some desirable properties, for example being traversable by a sufficiently large <mono>n<sup>2</sup></mono> block;
	</li>
	<li>
		Some of us contestants in the primary irc channel may have overruled the leader <mono>j3camero</mono> about the battle resolution to be used for the contest as we wanted it to be more strategically interesting, we may have been a tad harsh on how difficult that was to understand for newcomers, though to be fair the contest was more a culmination of the preceding two contests as well (kudos to those who managed to join in the fun without competing in some of the earlier contests). The description I gave from a mathematical perspective, which was perhaps only really helpful to myself, still seems to be available <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20150714224754/http://ants.aichallenge.org/specification_battle.php#math">here</a>;
	</li>
	<li>
		I was the developer of the <a href="https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/tree/epsilon/ants/dist/starter_bots/cpp">c++ starter bot</a> for the Ants challenge, used as a starting point for contestants intending to write their bot in c++;
	</li>
	<li>
		I was one of the designers and one of the authors of the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20131217090546/http://ants.aichallenge.org/specification.php">game specifications</a> for the Ants challenge;

<h4>results</h4>
<ul>
	<li>
		I'm the reigning Australian champion from the last two challenges, 1st out of 175 in the Ants challenge and 1st out of 122 in the Planet Wars challenge (<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20150322072152/http://ants.aichallenge.org/country_profile.php?country=25">Australian Ants leaderboard</a>, <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20110811062412/http://ai-contest.com/country_profile.php?country_id=25">Australian Planet Wars leaderboard</a>);
	</li>
	<li>
		I placed inside the top 1% globally in the last two challenges, 32nd out of 7897 in the Ants challenge and 36th out of 4617 in the Planet Wars challenge (<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20140216143242/http://ants.aichallenge.org/rankings.php">global Ants leaderboard</a>, <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20110819174404/http://ai-contest.com/rankings.php">global Planet Wars leaderboard</a>);
	</li>
	<li>
		You can find my implementation of my strategy for Planet Wars <a href="https://github.com/n-ham/Antimatroid-Planet-Wars-Bot">here</a> and my implementation of my strategy for Ants <a href="https://github.com/n-ham/Antimatroid-Ants-Bot">here</a>.
	</li>
	<li>
		I had the highest ranked version 1 bot in the Ants challenge (it is possible to sort the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20140216143242/http://ants.aichallenge.org/rankings.php">global leaderboard</a> by version number, however there is no direct link).
	</li>
	<li>
		You can still view some of my ants games <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20150406185457/http://ants.aichallenge.org/profile.php?user=98">here</a> and some of my planet wars games <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20110619060835/http://ai-contest.com/profile_games.php?user_id=3945">here</a> (including 5/5 wins against Accoun who finished 6 overall and who probably would have finished higher if not for me). <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20110619060747/http://ai-contest.com/visualizer.php?game_id=9559423">This</a> planet wars game is an interesting example of when I am not sure if the bot I implemented my strategy for made an extremely smart move (there was some code in there to consider end game scenarios) or whether it made a mistake and recovered (which is probably more likely where the end game scenario code might have paid off, though am unsure why it would have made the earlier move either).
