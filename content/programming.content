	I develop a non-opinionated high-performance web development framework <a href="https://nift.dev">Nift</a>. It has <a href="https://luajit.org/">LuaJIT</a> and <a href="http://www.partow.net/programming/exprtk/">ExprTk</a> (<a href="https://github.com/ArashPartow/exprtk">GitHub</a>) embedded along with in-built sibling template/scripting languages.

	I coded together a c/c++ implementation of <mono>lolcat</mono>, <a href="https://github.com/n-ham/lolcat-cc">lolcat-cc</a>. Check out especially the <a href="https://nift.dev/docs/fns/lolcat.on.html">lolcat.on</a> function for the <mono>Nift</mono> <a href="https://nift.dev/docs/REPL.html#shell">shell extension</a> called <mono>flashell</mono>.

	From 2010-2011 competed in, and contributed to organising a series of international ai contests sponsored by Google, commonly referred to as the Google ai challenges. Each participant developed a program, aka a bot, to play a game against bots developed by other contestants. Once submissions were closed, bots were matched against each other and ranked based on their performance using the popular skill-based ranking systems ELO and TrueSkill.

<h4>contributions</h4>
<ul>
	<li>
		<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20140102030230/http://ants.aichallenge.org/credits.php">Contributed</a> to designing and building the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20140102030245/http://ants.aichallenge.org/index.php">Ants challenge</a>, we ended up having 7897 people submit a bot;
	</li> 
	<li>
		Developed map generators used for both the Planet Wars and Ants challenges (see for example <a href="https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/blob/epsilon/ants/mapgen/mapgen.py">mapgen.py</a>, <a href="https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/blob/epsilon/ants/mapgen/symmetric_mapgen.py">symmetric-mapgen.py</a> and <a href="https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/blob/epsilon/ants/mapgen/asymmetric_mapgen.py">asymmetric-mapgen.py</a>, For the ants contest I was able to figure out how to do symmetric n player maps on the surface of a torus (edges wrapped), which enabled us to have symmetric games with any number of players;
	</li>
	<li>
		Developed the <a href="https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/tree/epsilon/ants/dist/starter_bots/cpp">c++ starter bot</a> for the Ants challenge, also used as a starting point for people who developed the starter bots for other languages;
	</li>
	<li>
		Helped flesh out the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20131217090546/http://ants.aichallenge.org/specification.php">game specifications</a> for the Ants challenge;
	</li>
</ul>
