<h3>Google ai challenges</h3>
<p>
	From 2010-2011 using the identity <mono>antimatroid</mono> I competed in, and contributed to designing and building an international artificial intelligence programming contest sponsored by Google, commonly known as the Google ai challenges. Each participant wrote a self-contained computer program, also known as a bot, to play a game against other people's bots. Once submissions were closed for each challenge, bots were matched against each other and ranked based on their performance.

	</li>
	<li>
		I had the highest ranked version 1 bot in the Ants challenge (it is possible to sort the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20140216143242/http://ants.aichallenge.org/rankings.php">global leaderboard</a> by version number, however there is no direct link).

		You can still view some of my ants games <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20150406185457/http://ants.aichallenge.org/profile.php?user=98">here</a> and some of my planet wars games <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20110619060835/http://ai-contest.com/profile_games.php?user_id=3945">here</a> (including 5/5 wins against Accoun who finished 6 overall and who probably would have finished higher if not for me).

<h3>nifty site manager</h3>
<p>
	I wrote a git-like site manager that tracks modifications to page dependencies. More information can be found on the <a href="https://nifty-site-manager.com">nsm site</a>.
