	This is the personal site of Nicholas Ham. I hold a doctorate in mathematics from the University of Tasmania, which I did having the advisors of <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=IGXAO_cAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao">Desmond FitzGerald</a> and <a href="https://www.utas.edu.au/profiles/staff/maths-physics/peter-jarvis">Peter Jarvis</a> (<a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C5&q=PD+jarvis&btnG=">Google Scholar</a><#--, <a href="http://www-theory.phys.utas.edu.au/theory/jarvis/jarvis.html">personal</a>--#>).

	On top of completing a mathematics major during undergrad, I also completed majors in analytical economics and applied computing. Furthermore I contributed to designing and building an international programming competition sponsored by Google, and have experience teaching both mathematics and economics classes at the undergraduate level.

	I'm the creator and developer of a website generator called <a href="https://nift.dev">Nift</a> which seems to benchmark as the world's fastest, though more people are encouraged to run and release their own benchmarks, you can even use Nift to make a website for the benchmarks.
