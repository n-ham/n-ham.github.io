	Personal site of Nicholas Ham. I hold a doctorate in mathematics from the University of Tasmania, during which I had <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=IGXAO_cAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao">Desmond FitzGerald</a> and <a href="https://www.utas.edu.au/profiles/staff/maths-physics/peter-jarvis">Peter Jarvis</a> (<a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C5&q=PD+jarvis&btnG=">Google Scholar</a>) as advisors.

	Amongst other open source projects, I develop a non-opinionated high-performance web development framework <a href="https://nift.dev">Nift</a>.

	On top of completing a mathematics major during undergrad, I completed majors in analytical economics and applied computing. I also contributed to designing and building an international programming competition sponsored by Google, and have experience teaching both mathematics and economics classes at the undergraduate level.

	I also enjoy playing around with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_art">generative art</a> (<a href="@pathto(generative_art)">examples</a>) using an existing image or video as a canvas along with <a href="https://opencv.org/">opencv</a> to access the <mono>RGB</mono> values at each pixel, coding c/c++ to generate frames using various of my own algorithmic techniques along with custom <mono>RGB@ent(<->)HSV</mono> conversion algorithms (none of <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3018313/algorithm-to-convert-rgb-to-hsv-and-hsv-to-rgb-in-range-0-255-for-both">these</a> work correctly), then combine the generated frames using <a href="https://ffmpeg.org/">ffmpeg</a>.
