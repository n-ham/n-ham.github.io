<h1>Generative Art</h1>

<p>
	I enjoy playing around with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_art">generative art</a> using an existing image or video as a canvas along with <a href="https://opencv.org/">opencv</a> to access the <mono>RGB</mono> values at each pixel, coding c/c++ to generate frames using various of my own algorithmic techniques along with custom <mono>RGB@ent(<->)HSV</mono> conversion algorithms (none of <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3018313/algorithm-to-convert-rgb-to-hsv-and-hsv-to-rgb-in-range-0-255-for-both">these</a> work correctly for high quality digital animations), then combine the generated frames using <a href="https://ffmpeg.org/">ffmpeg</a>, so basically like <a href="@pathtofile(output/assets/images/draw_owl.webp)">this</a>. See also <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithmic_art">algorithmic art</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_art">computer art</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_art">digital art</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_art">electronic art</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence_art">artificial intelligence art</a>.

	Below are some examples of art with the colours digitally animated, many of them in my opinion are both visually stunning and mesmerising borderline hypnotic:

	</ul>

<p>
	With the exception of the indigenous artwork and looping videos, almost all of the base artwork has been generated by <a href="https://midjourney.com/">Midjourney</a> then posted on Twitter by various people putting out some fantastic pieces (see alt text of examples for sources), which takes a surprising amount of creativity and skill if you have not gotten your hands dirty with text to image models yet. There has been insane progress with machine learning and/or artificial intelligence models in the last few years including text to image, the highest quality of which I have found seem to be coming from Midjourney, though various groups are regularly improving the models they are releasing. For example Stable Diffusion, Dall-E, Pirate Diffusion, etc., it's also worth checking out websites like <a href="https://lexica.art/">Lexica</a> (similar to Google image search, but for a database of AI generated images).
